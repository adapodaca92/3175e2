## Description

Please include a summary of the changes and a link to which issue is fixed.

Closes #2

For both the Login and Signup files I imported the necessary technologies to style and implement the Figma design. Then applied the necessary styling to all Material UI components according to the design, as well as allowing for mobile responsiveness.

## Notes on your approach and thought process

Please leave some notes explaining your thought process and your approach to solving this issue.

To reduce the code repitition I created a SidebarImage component to reuse in both the Signup and Login files. I also referred to the Figma design spec to fix the sizing for several components. I then used Material UI breakpoints to account for mobile responsiveness instead of CSS media queries.
