## Description

Please include a summary of the changes and a link to which issue is fixed.

Closes #1

For both the Login and Signup files I imported the necessary technologies to style and implement the Figma design. Then applied the necessary styling to all Material UI components according to the design, as well as allowing for mobile responsiveness.

## Notes on your approach and thought process

Please leave some notes explaining your thought process and your approach to solving this issue.

My thought process was to first review and research the Material UI documentation. After getting a better understanding about the components, I then imported makeStyles, and used useStyles to implement the styling to the Material UI components used. After implementing the styling I used media queries to account for mobile responsiveness.
